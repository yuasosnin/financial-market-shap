	abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted in research areas concerned with sequential data, such as text, audio, and video. However, RNNs consisting of sigma cells or tanh cells are unable to learn the relevant information of input data when the input gap is large. By introducing gate functions into the cell structure, the long short-term memory (LSTM) could handle the problem of long-term dependencies well. Since its introduction, almost all the exciting results based on RNNs have been achieved by the LSTM. The LSTM has become the focus of deep learning. We review the LSTM cell and its variants to explore the learning capacity of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, the LSTM networks are divided into two broad categories: LSTM-dominated networks and integrated LSTM networks. In addition, their various applications are discussed. Finally, future research directions are presented for LSTM networks.},

	abstract = {While two different streams of literature exist investigating 1) the relationship between oil prices and emerging market stock prices and 2) the relationship between oil prices and exchange rates, relatively little is known about the dynamic relationship between oil prices, exchange rates and emerging market stock prices. This paper proposes and estimates a structural vector autoregression model to investigate the dynamic relationship between these variables. Impulse responses are calculated in two ways (standard and the recently developed projection based methods). The model supports stylized facts. In particular, positive shocks to oil prices tend to depress emerging market stock prices and US dollar exchange rates in the short run. The model also captures stylized facts regarding movements in oil prices. A positive oil production shock lowers oil prices while a positive shock to real economic activity increases oil prices. There is also evidence that increases in emerging market stock prices increase oil prices.},

The study covers descriptive statistics, multicollinearity test, hypothesis tests, determination test, and prediction using FFT curve fitting. The results unveil four fresh and robust evidence. Partially, the interest rate has affected positively and significantly the stock market index. Partially, the exchange rate has affected negatively and significantly the stock market index. The F-test result, interest rate, and exchange rate have significantly affected the stock market index (JKSE) simultaneously. Furthermore, the FFT curve fitting has predicted that the stock market fluctuates and increases over time. The results have shown a strong influence of the independent variables and the dependent variable. The value of Adjusted R-Square is 0.719, which means that the independent variables have simultaneously impacted the dependent variable for 71.9\%; other factors have influenced the remaining 28.1\%.},

Our findings indicate that oil price rises have a negative impact on equity returns for all sectors except mining, and oil and gas industries. Generally, these results are consistent with economic theory and evidence provided by previous empirical studies. Little evidence of any asymmetry is detected in the oil price sensitivities. In light of our findings, we recommend that international portfolio investors consider hedging oil price risk.},

However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.},

This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs (≈15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Machine Learning (ML) researchers came up with various models and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant amount of surveys exist covering ML for financial time series forecasting studies. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models started appearing within the field, with results that significantly outperform traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time series forecasting research, there is a lack of review papers that were solely focused on DL for finance. Hence, our motivation in this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review on DL studies for financial time series forecasting implementations. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, commodity forecasting, but also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future for the field by highlighting the possible setbacks and opportunities, so the interested researchers can benefit.},

The data was collected from secondary data in the form of JCI daily data, gold prices, and exchange rate during the COVID-19 pandemic period from January 2020 to June 2020. Further, the data was analyzed by using a GARCH method to examine the effect of changes in gold and USD prices for CSPI and stock volatility. Hence, DCCGARCH method was used to see the dynamic correlation between CSPI with gold and IHSG with exchange rate. The result showed that changes of gold prices has significant effect of on stock price volatility, the presence of a positive dynamic correlation between CSPI and gold, and a negative dynamic correlation between CSPI and exchange rates. This research can be used as a reference for investors for their investments by looking at the relationship between the CSPI, gold, and the exchange rate.},

Therefore, this paper modifies the procedure of Kilian and Park (2009) and investigates how explicit structural shocks that characterize the endogenous character of changes in oil prices affect three large NIEs' stock-market returns, in order to fill this gap. From the empirical analysis, we find that the impact of oil price shocks on stock prices in these large NIEs is mixed, partly in contrast to the effects on the U.S. and developed countries' stock markets. This result is also consistent with the previous empirical findings that the NIEs' stock markets are “partially integrated” with the other stock markets and oil price shocks.},

The danger, in the absence of a stock take, is that we will produce a large volume of studies on how oil prices interact with stock returns without them having any real impact on the profession. This paper is a response to this concern. It highlights the key themes researched, main ﬁndings and, equally importantly, identiﬁes key challenges and suggests an agenda for future research on the interaction between oil prices and stock returns and oil prices and the ﬁnancial sector more generally.},

An increase in economic activity and the money supply increases stock market prices, while increases in inflation and interest rates decrease stock prices. The results suggest that equities are not a hedge against inflation in Namibia, and contractionary monetary policy generally depresses stock prices. Increasing economic activity promotes stock market price development.},

In this paper, we address this limitation using a structural VAR analysis. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: First, the magnitude, duration, and even direction of response by stock market in a country to oil price shocks highly depend on whether the country is a net importer or exporter in the world oil market, and whether changes in oil price are driven by supply or aggregate demand. Second, the relative contribution of each type of oil price shocks depends on the level of importance of oil to national economy, as well as the net position in oil market and the driving forces of oil price changes. Third, the effects of aggregate demand uncertainty on stock markets in oil-exporting countries are much stronger and more persistent than in oil-importing countries. Finally, positive aggregate and precautionary demand shocks are shown to result in a higher degree of co-movement among the stock markets in oil-exporting countries, but not among those in oil-importing countries.},

These industries are affected either by oil futures returns, oil futures return volatility or both. In general, excess returns of the oil-user industries are more likely to be affected by changes in the volatility of oil returns, than those of oil return itself. Volatilities of industry excess returns are time-varying, and return volatility for a number of sectors, appears to have long memory.

The contemporaneous correlation results show that i) although time-varying correlation does not differ for oil-importing and oil-exporting economies, ii) the correlation increases positively (negatively) in respond to important aggregate demand-side (precautionary demand) oil price shocks, which are caused due to global business cycle's fluctuations or world turmoil (i.e. wars). Supply-side oil price shocks do not influence the relationship of the two markets. The lagged correlation results show that oil prices exercise a negative effect in all stock markets, regardless the origin of the oil price shock. The only exception is the 2008 global financial crisis where the lagged oil prices exhibit a positive correlation with stock markets. Finally, we conclude that in periods of significant economic turmoil the oil market is not a “safe haven” for offering protection against stock market losses.},

Monthly data are used for the period January 2008 till June 2015. The nonlinear ARDL approach is applied in order to find short-run and long-run asymmetries. The empirical results indicate that gold prices have a positive impact on stock market prices of large emerging BRICS economies and a negative impact on the stock markets of Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, Chile and Indonesia. Oil prices have a negative impact on stock markets of all emerging economies. Gold and oil volatilities have a negative impact on stock markets of all emerging economies in both the short- and the long-run. The results indicate that the stock markets in the emerging economies are more vulnerable to bad news and events that result in uncertain economic conditions.},

The current literature in financial economics offers differing opininon on each of these relationship. This research addresses a significant aspect of this debate by examining the direction of causality between the money supply, stock prices and interest rates. Using Granger–Sims' test for determining unidirectional causality, we find that the relationship between the money supply and stock prices is characterized by a feedback system, with money supply causing some of the observed variations in the stock price levels and vice versa. With respect to the relationship between stock prices and interest rates, the results are not as conclusive. In this instance, the causality seems to be mostly running from interest rates to stock prices, and not the other way around.},

The stock duration model is used to measure the sensitivity in variations in inflation rates and interest rates on stock prices. Design/methodology/approach The authors use standard statistical tools that include Johansen cointegration test, linearity, normality tests, cointegration regression, Granger causality and vector error correction model. Findings The results of panel Johansen cointegration analysis show that cointegration exists between the stock prices, the changes in stock prices due to inflation rates and the changes in stock prices due to real interest rates. The results of cointegration regression show that inflation rates are negatively associated with stock prices, the real interest rates and stock prices are positively associated, changes in real interest rates and inflation rates Granger cause significant changes in stock prices, significant speed of adjustment to long run equilibrium between observed stock prices and real interest rates and significant speed of adjustment to long run equilibrium between changes in stock prices due to real interest rates and changes in inflation rates. Originality/value This paper contributes to the empirical literature in three ways. The paper examines the effects of inflation and interest rates on stock prices differently from other related studies by separating inflation from real interest rates. The paper examines the causality between stock prices, interest and inflation rates. This paper offers significant updated validity to extended literature that a negative association exists between stock prices and inflation rates. This validity can be considered as an existence a theory of stock prices, inflation rates and interest rates.},

	abstract = {Numerous empirical studies establish that inflation has a negative short-run effect on stock returns but few studies report a positive, long-run Fisher effect for stock returns. Using stock price and goods price data from six industrial countries, we show that long-run Fisher elasticities of stock prices with respect to goods prices exceed unity and range from 1.04 to 1.65, which tends to support the Fisher effect. We also find that the time path of the response of stock prices to a shock in goods prices exhibits an initial negative response, which turns positive over longer horizons. These results help reconcile previous short-run and long-run empirical evidence on stock returns and inflation. Also, they reveal that stock prices have a long memory with respect to inflation shocks, such that investors should expect stocks to be a good inflation hedge over a long holding period.

According to the portfolio balance effect theory in periods of financial crisis there is a causal relationship from stock returns to exchange rate returns. Previous studies detect this relationship in short-run but not in long-run level. However, they use, for testing the long-run relationship, standard linear cointegrating regression models that suffer from biased estimations and cannot detect non-linear relationships. To overcome these problems, we examine the long-run relationship adopting a more advanced econometric model, the structural nonparametric cointegrating regression. The results exhibit a causal relationship from stock prices to exchange rates that is long-run in EU and short-run in USA. The finding of long-run relationship with this direction is particularly important because it is presented for first time in relative literature and shows the need for a new pattern of economic policy in EU.},

	abstract = {Dramatic oil price movements could spill over to the stock market, which may be weakened or reinforced by the exchange rate, particularly for net oil importing and exporting countries. Unlike previous studies considering the relationship between the stock market and the oil price quoted in USD, we explore the impact of real oil price quoted in corresponding currency on the stock markets of China and Russia by involving the nominal exchange rates through various time horizons during the sample period from January 2000 to October 2015. Furthermore, the relationship between the effective exchange rate and the oil-stock nexus is examined in a dynamic manner. The main results are as follows: first, Russian stock market responds greater to the combined influence of the oil price and exchange rate than Chinese stock market. Specifically, the bidirectional Granger causality relations running between the real oil price and stock markets are in scale 1 and 6 for China, but exist in scales 1–6 for Russia. Compared with previous studies, we infer that the exchange rate weakens the response of Chinese stock market to the oil price but close Russian oil-stock nexus. Moreover, the oil price increase could depress Chinese stock market in scale 6, while such increase has positive effect on Russian stock market in scales 2–6. Further dynamic analysis demonstrates that the correlations between the effective exchange rates and the oil-stock nexuses for both China and Russia are high and fluctuated in scales 1–4, but decrease after 2014 when the effective exchange rates of China and Russia move in the opposite direction in the long term.},

	abstract = {Forex (foreign exchange) is a special financial market that entails both high risks and high profit opportunities for traders. It is also a very simple market since traders can profit by just predicting the direction of the exchange rate between two currencies. However, incorrect predictions in Forex may cause much higher losses than in other typical financial markets.The direction prediction requirement makes the problem quite different from other typical time-series forecasting problems. In this work, we used a popular deep learning tool called “long short-term memory” (LSTM), which has been shown to be very effective in many time-series forecasting problems, to make direction predictions in Forex. We utilized two different data sets—namely, macroeconomic data and technical indicator data—since in the financial world, fundamental and technical analysis are two main techniques, and they use those two data sets, respectively. Our proposed hybrid model, which combines two separate LSTMs corresponding to these two data sets, was found to be quite successful in experiments using real data.},

	abstract = {The stock market is affected by many factors, such as political events, general economic conditions, and traders’ expectations. Predicting the direction of stock markets movement has been one of the most widely investigated and challenging problems for investors and researchers as well. Many researchers focus on stock market analysis using advanced knowledge of mathematics, computer sciences, economics and many other disciplines. In this paper, we present an improved sine cosine algorithm (ISCA), which introduces an additional parameter into the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), to optimize the weights and basis of back propagation neural networks (BPNN). Thus, ISCA and BPNN are combined to create a new network, ISCA-BPNN, for predicting the directions of the opening stock prices for the S\&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average Indices, respectively. In addition, Google Trends data are taken into consideration for improving stock prediction. We analyze two types of prediction: Type I is the prediction without Google Trends and Type II is the prediction with Google Trends. The predictability of stock price direction is verified by using the hybrid ISCA-BPNN model. The experimental results indicate that ISCA–BPNN outperforms BPNN, GWO-BPNN, PSO-BPNN, WOA-BPNN and SCA-BPNN in terms of predicting the direction of the opening price for both types and significantly for Type II. The hit ratios for ISCA-BPNN with Google Trends reach 86.81\% for the S\&P 500 Index, and 88.98\% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. Our results show that Google Trends can help in predicting the direction of the stock market index.},

	abstract = {Stock price forecasting is an important and thriving topic in financial engineering especially since new techniques and approaches on this matter are gaining ground constantly. In the contemporary era, the ceaseless use of social media has reached unprecedented levels, which has led to the belief that the expressed public sentiment could be correlated with the behavior of stock prices. The idea is to recognize patterns which confirm this correlation and use them to predict the future behavior of the various stock prices. With no doubt, though uninteresting individually, tweets can provide a satisfactory reflection of public sentiment when taken in aggregate. In this paper, we develop a system which collects past tweets, processes them further, and examines the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes Bernoulli classification and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for providing a positive or negative sentiment on the tweet corpus. Subsequently, we employ the same machine learning algorithms to analyze how tweets correlate with stock market price behavior. Finally, we examine our prediction's error by comparing our algorithm's outcome with next day's actual close price. Overall, the ultimate goal of this project is to forecast how the market will behave in the future via sentiment analysis on a set of tweets over the past few days, as well as to examine if the theory of contrarian investing is applicable. The final results seem to be promising as we found correlation between sentiment of tweets and stock prices.},

However, in addition to quantified data, financial news often has a nonnegligible impact on stock price. Nowadays, as new reviews are posted daily on social media, there may be value in using web opinions to improve the performance of stock price prediction. To this end, we use logistic regression to screen the chip indicators and establish a basic stock price prediction model. Then, we employ text mining technology to quantify the unstructured data of social media opinions on stock-related news into sentiment scores, which are found to correlate significantly with the change extent of the stock price. Based on the findings that the higher the sentiment scores, the lower the prediction accuracy of the logistic regression model, we propose an improved prediction approach that integrates sentiment scores into the logistic regression model. Our results show that the proposed model can improve the prediction accuracy for stock prices, and can thus provide a new reference for investment strategies for stock investors.},

This article studies the usage of LSTM networks on that scenario, to predict future trends of stock prices based on the price history, alongside with technical analysis indicators. For that goal, a prediction model was built, and a series of experiments were executed and theirs results analyzed against a number of metrics to assess if this type of algorithm presents and improvements when compared to other Machine Learning methods and investment strategies. The results that were obtained are promising, getting up to an average of 55.9\% of accuracy when predicting if the price of a particular stock is going to go up or not in the near future.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamic dependence between crude oil prices and stock markets in ten countries across the Asia-Pacific region during the period from January 4, 2000 to March 30, 2012 by using unconditional and conditional copula models. The model is implemented using an AR (p)-GARCH (1, 1)-t model for the marginal distributions and constant and time-varying copulas for the joint distribution. The results show that the dependence between crude oil prices and Asia-Pacific stock market returns is generally weak, that it was positive before the global financial crisis, except in Hong Kong, and that it increased significantly in the aftermath of the crisis. The lower tail dependence between oil prices and Asia-Pacific stock markets exceeds that of the upper tail dependence, except in Japan and Singapore in the post-crisis period. Moreover, we show that time-varying copulas best capture the tail dependence and that taking the tail correlation into account leads to improved accuracy of VaR estimates. These findings have important implications for investors interested in Asia-Pacific markets for portfolio diversification, risk management, and international asset allocation.},

In the proposed model, we allow the coefficient on the oil price index to be a time-varying function which evolves over time in a way that is assumed to be unknown. We also allow the common trend function to evolve over time, as well as extending the model further to incorporate country-specific trend functions. We employ a data-driven local linear method to estimate these time-varying trend and coefficient functions. The results show that, despite being largely positive, there are several downward trends, reflecting the aftermath of the Iraq war and the recent unprecedented drop in the oil price. Overall, we find that the nonparametric panel data model better captures the way in which the underlying stock-oil price relationship has evolved over time in comparison to the point estimates of the parametric counterpart. Moreover, we find that stock market fundamentals play a significant role in determining the oil-stock price relationship. Our findings have important implication for policymakers and financial speculators.},

Findings suggest that oil prices and the stock market exercise a positive effect on the Greek CPI, in the long run. Cyclical components analysis suggests that oil prices exercise significant negative influence to the stock market. In addition, oil prices are negatively influencing CPI, at a significant level. However, we find no effect of oil prices on industrial production and CPI. Finally, no relationship can be documented between the industrial production and stock market for the Greek market.

This paper proposes and estimates a structural vector autoregression model to investigate the dynamic relationship between these variables. Impulse responses are calculated in two ways (standard and the recently developed projection based methods). The model supports stylized facts. In particular, positive shocks to oil prices tend to depress emerging market stock prices and US dollar exchange rates in the short run. The model also captures stylized facts regarding movements in oil prices. A positive oil production shock lowers oil prices while a positive shock to real economic activity increases oil prices. There is also evidence that increases in emerging market stock prices increase oil prices.},

The survey used presents the results through the most used performance metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), accuracy, Sharpe ratio, and return rate. We identified that recent models combining LSTM with other methods, for example, DNN, are widely researched.

	abstract = {Stock price prediction has always been a hot but challenging task due to the complexity and randomness in stock market. Investors and researchers usually derive a great number of factors from original data such as historical stock price, company profit, or textual data collected from social media. Normally these factors are then fed into models like linear regression, SVM or neural networks to make a prediction. Even though the number of factors are considerable, most of them have relatively weak correlations with future stock price. During training process, these factors not only result in additional computation but sometimes even be harmful to the performance of prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-input LSTM model which is capable of extracting valuable information from low-correlated factors and discarding their harmful noise by employing extra input gates controlled by the convincing factors called {\textbackslash}emph\{mainstream\}. We also introduce several new factors including the prices of other related stocks to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental results on the stock data from China stock market demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

We empirically test the impact of daily values of fundamental factors (indexes of foreign stock markets, oil price, exchange rate and interest rates in Russia and the USA) on the MOEX Russia Index over long time interval from 2003 to 2018. The analysis of the ARIMA-GARCH (1,1) model with a rolling window reveals the changes in the power and direction of the influence of the fundamental factors which are probably caused by the structural instability revealed earlier in Russia and other stock markets. The Quandt-Andrews breakpoint test and Bai-Perron test identify the number and likely location of the structural breaks. We find multiple breaks probably associated with dramatic falls in the stock market index, for example with the significant falls of the then MICEX index in the spring of 2006 and the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The results of the regression models over the different regimes, defined by the structural breaks, can vary markedly over time.},

The empirical results show that the LSTM performs a better prediction effect, and it shows excellent effects on the static prediction and dynamic trend prediction of the financial time series, which indicates its applicability and effectiveness to the prediction of financial time series.

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning techniques have outperformed traditional models in many machine learning tasks. Deep neural networks have successfully been applied to address time series forecasting problems, which is a very important topic in data mining. They have proved to be an effective solution given their capacity to automatically learn the temporal dependencies present in time series. However, selecting the most convenient type of deep neural network and its parametrization is a complex task that requires considerable expertise. Therefore, there is a need for deeper studies on the suitability of all existing architectures for different forecasting tasks. In this work, we face two main challenges: a comprehensive review of the latest works using deep learning for time series forecasting and an experimental study comparing the performance of the most popular architectures. The comparison involves a thorough analysis of seven types of deep learning models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate the rankings and distribution of results obtained with the proposed models under many different architecture configurations and training hyperparameters. The datasets used comprise more than 50,000 time series divided into 12 different forecasting problems. By training more than 38,000 models on these data, we provide the most extensive deep learning study for time series forecasting. Among all studied models, the results show that long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional networks (CNN) are the best alternatives, with LSTMs obtaining the most accurate forecasts. CNNs achieve comparable performance with less variability of results under different parameter configurations, while also being more efficient.},

Given the notion that a prediction with little forecast error does not necessarily translate into capital gain, this study is an attempt to predict the direction of S\&P CNX NIFTY Market Index of the National Stock Exchange, one of the fastest growing financial exchanges in developing Asian countries. Random forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are very specific type of machine learning method, and are promising tools for the prediction of financial time series. The tested classification models, which predict direction, include linear discriminant analysis, logit, artificial neural network, random forest and SVM. Empirical experimentation suggests that the SVM outperforms the other classification methods in terms of predicting the direction of the stock market movement and random forest method outperforms neural network, discriminant analysis and logit model used in this study.},

	abstract = {Forecasting time series data is an important subject in economics, business, and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive (AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series data, such as "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)", are superior to the traditional algorithms. The empirical studies conducted and reported in this article show that deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM outperform traditional-based algorithms such as ARIMA model. More specifically, the average reduction in error rates obtained by LSTM is between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that the number of training times, known as "epoch" in deep learning, has no effect on the performance of the trained forecast model and it exhibits a truly random behavior.},

We find that stock prices, oil prices and nominal exchange rates are cointegrated, and oil prices have a positive and statistically significant impact on stock prices. This result is inconsistent with theoretical expectations. The growth of the Vietnamese stock market was accompanied by rising oil prices. However, the boom of the stock market was marked by increasing foreign portfolio investment inflows which are estimated to have doubled from US\$0.9 billion in 2005 to US\$1.9 billion in 2006. There was also a change in preferences from holding foreign currencies and domestic bank deposits to stocks local market participants, and there was a rise in leveraged investment in stock as well as investments on behalf of relatives living abroad. It seems that the impact of these internal and domestic factors were more dominant than the oil price rise on the Vietnamese stock market.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to identify various macroeconomic variables that affect the stock market performance of developed and emerging economies. It also investigates the effect of these factors on the stock markets of both economies. The impact of these variables on broad market indices and sectoral indices is investigated and compared too. Design/methodology/approach The publications for the study were retrieved from databases such as Emerald Insight, EBSCO, ScienceDirect and JSTOR using the keywords “Macroeconomic variables” and “Stock market” or “Stock market performance.” The result demonstrated a growing corpus of scholarly work in the domain of stock market. The study was carried out separately for each macroeconomic indicator. Given a large number of articles under consideration, the authors began by reading the titles and abstracts of all publications to identify those that were relevant. The papers are evaluated in Excel and the articles for review range from 1972 to 2021. Findings The authors found that gross domestic product (GDP), FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and FII (Foreign Institutional Investment) have a positive effect on both emerging and developed economies’ stock market while gold price has a negative effect. Interest rates had a negative impact on both economies except for a few developing countries. The relationship with oil prices was positive for oil exporting countries while negative for oil importing countries. Inflation, money supply and GDP are the macroeconomic variables that have the same effect on sectoral indices as they do on broad market indices. The impact was sector-specific for the remaining variables. Research limitations/implications This paper gives an overview of relation and effect covering variety of macroeconomic variables and stock market indices. Still, there is a scope for further research to analyze the effect on thematic, strategy and sectoral indices. A longer time horizon with new variables, such as bank deposit growth rate, nonperforming assets of banks, consumer confidence index and investor sentiment, can be studied using high-frequency data. This research may help stakeholders adopt and manage their policies during a crisis or economic slump. Practical implications This study will assist investors, researchers and educators in the fields of economics and finance in understanding how macroeconomic factors affect the stock market. Furthermore, this study can guide in portfolio diversification strategy across multiple sectors by examining the impact of macroeconomic factors specific to sectoral indices. This paper provides insight into society and researchers since it integrates a number of macroeconomic variables and their interaction with the stock market. It may also help pension funds and mutual fund firms to hedge their funds and allocate equity portfolios. Originality/value With respect to India, this study looked at new macroeconomic variables and sectors. It contrasted the impact of these variables in developed and developing economies. The effect of broad and sectoral stock indexes was also investigated and compared. The authors examined how these variables responded during crisis and economic downturns by using articles from a longer time frame. This research also looked into how changing the frequency of data for the variables altered stock performance. This paper emphasized the need for more research into thematic, strategy and broad market indices, such as small-cap and mid-cap indices.},

of micro and macro variables. The study carried out via applying a fixed panel data analysis and Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel Granger causality test for the period spans from 1995 3rd quarter to 2015 4th quarter. In general, both macro and micro variables can reliably price the bank stocks. Specifically, the findings show that asset quality, management quality, earning, size, money supply and interest rate are significantly related to stock price. Also, bidirectional causality found between bank size, asset quality, money supply and bank stock price. In other words, investors should pay attention to bank specific information in their decision. Moreover, the result indicates that bank stock prices react negatively to economic crisis.},

	abstract = {The volatility of equity returns generally exhibits an asymmetric reaction to positive and negative shocks. Economic explanations for this phenomenon are leverage and a volatility feedback effect. This article studies the volatility of gold and demonstrates that there is an inverted asymmetric reaction to positive and negative shocks—positive shocks increase volatility more than negative shocks. The author argues that this effect is related to the safe-haven property of gold. Investors interpret positive gold price changes as a signal for future adverse conditions and uncertainty in other asset markets. This introduces uncertainty in the gold market and thus higher volatility. The empirical results hold for gold bullion and gold coins denominated in different currencies and for different return frequencies, sample periods, and distributional assumptions. Finally, the author shows that the inverted volatility effect of gold can lower the aggregate risk of a portfolio for specific correlation levels.

	abstract = {Objectives Current mortality prediction models used in the intensive care unit (ICU) have a limited role for specific diseases such as influenza, and we aimed to establish an explainable machine learning (ML) model for predicting mortality in critically ill influenza patients using a real-world severe influenza data set.
Study design A cross-sectional retrospective multicentre study in Taiwan
Setting Eight medical centres in Taiwan.
Participants A total of 336 patients requiring ICU-admission for virology-proven influenza at eight hospitals during an influenza epidemic between October 2015 and March 2016.
Primary and secondary outcome measures We employed extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to establish the prediction model, compared the performance with logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF), demonstrated the feature importance categorised by clinical domains, and used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for visualised interpretation.
Results The data set contained 76 features of the 336 patients with severe influenza. The severity was apparently high, as shown by the high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (22, 17 to 29) and pneumonia severity index score (118, 88 to 151). XGBoost model (area under the curve (AUC): 0.842; 95\% CI 0.749 to 0.928) outperformed RF (AUC: 0.809; 95\% CI 0.629 to 0.891) and LR (AUC: 0.701; 95\% CI 0.573 to 0.825) for predicting 30-day mortality. To give clinicians an intuitive understanding of feature exploitation, we stratified features by the clinical domain. The cumulative feature importance in the fluid balance domain, ventilation domain, laboratory data domain, demographic and symptom domain, management domain and severity score domain was 0.253, 0.113, 0.177, 0.140, 0.152 and 0.165, respectively. We further used SHAP plots to illustrate associations between features and 30-day mortality in critically ill influenza patients.
Conclusions We used a real-world data set and applied an ML approach, mainly XGBoost, to establish a practical and explainable mortality prediction model in critically ill influenza patients.},
